# BookList-app
Basic application written with html, bootstrap and vanilla javascript. An app that creates a new book and displays it on the DOM.
The app uses bootstrap to take care of styling to keep it simple.
On the other side uses vanilla Js to write up our functionality.
Users can write up a new book via our forms, see the book displayed on the DOM and remove the books.
The form used also contains some light validation.
